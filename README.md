# inu-v2-b

A photo portfolio theme with React, WPGraphQL and Create React WPTheme.

## Development process

Based on [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html).

### Mocks - v0.0.1

Notes:

- Items with gray background represents data.

Instructions:

- Don't just output plain text like `Displays site title`. Try first to create a `title` proptype and output something like `Displays {title}`. This makes sure the components are defined based on `real` data.
- if you write nice texts a requirement specification is generated.

1. Mocking up the component structure and the functionality

4. Create requirement specification

With a little text cleanup the requirement specification is done!
