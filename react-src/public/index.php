        If you're reading this from "view source" in your browser, it might not make sense as
        these tokens have already been evaluated and replaced, even in this remark blurb.

        Notice the use of "php echo $TEMPLATE_PATH;" and %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
        Both will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build (%PUBLIC_URL%) or
        at render time (php echo $TEMPLATE_PATH;)
        Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced like this.

        Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
        work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
        Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run wpbuild`.
